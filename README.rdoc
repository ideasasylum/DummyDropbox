= DummyDropbox

    *NOTE*: This is a fork of the original dummy_dropbox[https://github.com/fguillen/DummyDropbox] which adds mime type metadata, accurate file attributes, properly mocked metadata struct (e.g. with .members) and thumbnail downloads

<b>I can image a Dropbox session, just for testing.</b>

Very simple library for mocking the dropbox_ruby_gem[http://rubygems.org/gems/dropbox].

You can test your application without making real calls to Dropbox API using a *local* *folder* to fake a Dropbox account.


== Install

    $ [sudo] gem install dummy_dropbox


== Usage

    require 'dummy_dropbox'
    
    # Optional:
    # Point where your local folder structure is located.
    # It will be used as if the real Dropbox structure was been reading.
    DummyDropbox.root_path = <your_local_folder> 
    
    session = Dropbox::Session.new('key', 'secret')
    assert_equal( File.read( "<your_local_folder>/file1.txt" ) , @session.download( '/file1.txt' ) )
    
See the *test* folder.


== TODO

The status of this dummy implementation is not very much completed, I just implemented enough for my proposes.

Please fork it and complete the holes as you need it, them send me your pull request.
